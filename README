## 🤖 Agent Architecture

FiMa uses a multi-agent system for intelligent, data-driven financial management:

### � Orchestrator Agent
- Acts as the financial “guru” and coordinator.
- Determines user intent (data retrieval, analysis, or UI generation).
- Delegates data fetching to the API Agent and UI generation to the UI Smith Agent.
- Provides actionable financial insights, spending analysis, and recommendations using real data only.

### � Agent API (Mini Agent)
- Specializes in retrieving accurate, relevant data from the Fima platform.
- Handles requests for budgets, transactions, goals, and more.
- Never generates, modifies, or interprets data—only fetches and returns factual results.

### 🟣 UI Smith Agent (Mini Agent)
- Generates static, responsive HTML components with inline CSS for the Fima frontend.
- Uses only real data provided by the Orchestrator Agent.
- Maintains a minimal, modern, and consistent visual style.

#### System Prompts (Agent Behaviors)
- **Orchestrator Agent:** Coordinates all requests, performs financial analysis, and ensures only real data is used for insights and UI.
- **Agent API:** Fetches platform data, never interprets or fabricates results, and asks for missing context if needed.
- **UI Smith Agent:** Produces clean HTML/CSS layouts, never analyzes data, and requests more details if data or layout instructions are missing.
